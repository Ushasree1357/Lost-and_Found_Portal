Scope Definition – Out-of-Scope Features:


1. Introduction
This document defines the out-of-scope features for the Lost & Found Portal.
Out-of-scope items are functionalities that are intentionally excluded from the current project version to maintain feasibility, clarity, and alignment with time and resource constraints.
