 Problem Statement:
Managing lost and found items on a university campus involves a significant amount of administrative effort, manual tracking, and inefficiency in matching lost items with those that are found. Students and staff often lose personal belongings in libraries, cafeterias, classrooms, or common areas, while others may find items but have no centralized way to return them. The current process is often fragmented—relying on physical notice boards, informal social media posts, or scattered departmental logs—which leads to low recovery rates, duplication of efforts, and frustration among users.
Additionally, campus security and administrative staff face challenges in maintaining organized records, verifying ownership, and facilitating the return of items. Without a unified digital system, there is no efficient way to search for items, notify owners, or track claim status. This results in prolonged resolution times, increased workload for staff, and a poor experience for students.
To address these challenges, the project proposes a Lost & Found Portal that provides a centralized, user-friendly platform for reporting, searching, matching, and managing lost and found items on campus, thereby improving recovery rates and operational efficiency.
