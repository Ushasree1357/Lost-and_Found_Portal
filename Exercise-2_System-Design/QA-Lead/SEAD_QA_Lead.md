# QA Lead – Lost and Found Portal

## Overview
The QA Lead is responsible for ensuring that the Lost and Found Portal functions correctly, reliably, securely, and meets all specified requirements before release. The role involves planning, executing, and monitoring all quality assurance activities throughout the project lifecycle.

## Responsibilities

The QA Lead reviews the Software Requirement Specification (SRS) and system workflows to identify all testable requirements related to lost item reporting, found item reporting, item validation, matching and ranking logic, notifications, and user dashboards. The QA Lead prepares the test plan, test strategy, and defines entry and exit criteria for each testing phase.

The QA Lead designs and manages detailed test cases covering item submission validation, duplicate detection, data parsing accuracy, matching relevance, ranking correctness, and claim–response workflows, including positive, negative, and edge case scenarios. Validation is performed to ensure mandatory fields are enforced, invalid or incomplete reports are handled correctly, and duplicate or fake submissions are filtered effectively.

The QA Lead verifies data parsing and analysis to ensure correct extraction of item attributes, proper categorization, and consistent structured storage without data loss. Matching and ranking logic is tested to confirm that relevant lost and found items are accurately matched and prioritized based on location proximity, time relevance, and description similarity, with regression testing conducted after any logic updates.

The QA Lead also validates notification mechanisms and result displays to ensure timely and accurate alerts, correct dashboard updates, and smooth claim and status workflows. Security testing is performed to ensure proper authentication, authorization, protection of personal data, and resistance to vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, insecure file uploads, and session handling issues.

Performance and load testing are conducted to evaluate system behavior under multiple concurrent users, assess matching speed and database response times, and identify performance bottlenecks. Throughout the testing process, the QA Lead manages defect tracking by logging issues with appropriate severity and priority, coordinating with developers for fixes, and verifying resolutions through re-testing and regression testing.

Before deployment, the QA Lead ensures release readiness by confirming that all critical defects are resolved, exit criteria are met, test reports are completed, and final QA sign-off is provided.
